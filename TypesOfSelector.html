        Gold is a chemical element; it has chemical symbol Au (from Latin aurum) and atomic number 79. In its pure form,
        it is a bright, slightly orange-yellow, dense, soft, malleable, and ductile metal. Chemically, gold is a
        transition metal, a group 11 element, and one of the noble metals. It is one of the least reactive chemical
        elements, being the second lowest in the reactivity series, with only platinum ranked as less reactive.[10] Gold
        is solid under standard conditions.

        Gold often occurs in free elemental (native state), as nuggets or grains, in rocks, veins, and alluvial
        deposits. It occurs in a solid solution series with the native element silver (as in electrum), naturally
        alloyed with other metals like copper and palladium, and mineral inclusions such as within pyrite. Less
        commonly, it occurs in minerals as gold compounds, often with tellurium (gold tellurides).
